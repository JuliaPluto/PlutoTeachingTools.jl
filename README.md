# PlutoTeachingTools

This package provides some of the useful functions that are useful in Pluto notebooks used for teaching.  The inital version is merely borrowing functions from modules and/or homeworks from the excellent MIT course, [Introduction to Computational Thinking
Math from computation, math with computation (Spring 2021)](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/).  
I hope that I and others will improve and/or contribute new functions that are of value to other educaitons.
