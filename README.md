# PlutoTeachingTools

This package provides several functions that are useful in Pluto notebooks used for teaching and making tutorials.  The initial version merely borrowed functions from modules and/or homeworks from the excellent MIT course, [Introduction to Computational Thinking
Math from computation, math with computation (Spring 2021)](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/). Since then, there have been several additions from various other packages, issues, and contributors.  

See the **[example notebook](https://juliapluto.github.io/PlutoTeachingTools.jl/example.html)** for functions provided.
Several functions have optional arguments that aren't (yet?) demonstrated in the example notebook.

Others are encouraged to improve and/or contribute new functions that are of value to other educators (in either formal or informal settings).  Pull Requests welcome, but please be patient when we are slow to review/merge PRs.

# Other useful packages for Pluto notebook tutorials
There are several existing package that also provide specific useful features.  We list them below to help other educators discover them
- [PlutoUI](https://github.com/fonsp/PlutoUI.jl): widgets
- [ShortCodes.jl](https://github.com/hellemo/ShortCodes.jl): embed DOIs, YouTube, Tweets, etc.
- [PlutoLinks.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPluto/PlutoLinks.jl): include code from separate files.
- [MarkdownLiteral.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPluto/MarkdownLiteral.jl): more powerful markdown (interpolation, html, string attributes...)
- [LaTeXStrings.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStrings/LaTeXStrings.jl): easily include LaTeX

If you find yourself often including other packages, please consider adding them to the list above.
