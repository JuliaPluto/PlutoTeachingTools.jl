# PlutoTeachingTools

This package provides some of the useful functions that are useful in Pluto notebooks used for teaching.  The inital version merely borrowed functions from modules and/or homeworks from the excellent MIT course, [Introduction to Computational Thinking
Math from computation, math with computation (Spring 2021)](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/).  Since there, I've made some minor tweaks and additions.

I've also added:
- WidthOverDocs from [PlutoThemes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPluto/PlutoThemes.jl)
- ingredients(path) from a [Pluto.jl discussion](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl/issues/115)

I hope that I and others will improve and/or contribute new functions that are of value to other educaitons.  PRs welcome.
