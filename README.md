# PlutoTeachingTools

This package provides some of the useful functions that are useful in Pluto notebooks used for teaching.  The inital version merely borrowed functions from modules and/or homeworks from the excellent MIT course, [Introduction to Computational Thinking
Math from computation, math with computation (Spring 2021)](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/).  Since there, there have been several additions from various other packages and issues.  

See the **[example notebook](https://juliapluto.github.io/PlutoTeachingTools.jl/example.html)** for functions provided.
Several functions have optional arguements that aren't (yet?) demonstrated in the example notebook.

I encourage others to improve and/or contribute new functions that are of value to other educators.  PRs welcome.
