# PlutoTeachingTools

This package provides some of the useful functions that are useful in Pluto notebooks used for teaching.  The inital version merely borrowed functions from modules and/or homeworks from the excellent MIT course, [Introduction to Computational Thinking
Math from computation, math with computation (Spring 2021)](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/).  Since there, I've made some minor tweaks and additions.

I've also added:
- present button
- WidthOverDocs (deprecated)
- ChooseDisplayMode (combines WidthOverDocs and Present mode)

- `@ingredients(path)` from [PlutoLinks.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPluto/PlutoLinks.jl)
- `aside`

- `TwoColumn`, `ThreeColumn`, `TwoColumnWideLeft`, `TwoColumnWideRight`
- Foldable & `protip` 
- Several functions for checking that variables are defined, have the intended type or include a substring.

See the example.jl notebook for examples.

I hope that I and others will improve and/or contribute new functions that are of value to other educaitons.  PRs welcome.
